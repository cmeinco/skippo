SKIPPO for Kippo HoneyPot

#Storm Configuration

This details the steps needed to setup all your honeypots to forward to Splunk Storm to gather intel across all your Honey pots.

#Steps
1. Install & Configure Kippo
2. Install Splunk Forwarder
3. Install Splunk Storm Forwarder
4. Install skippo-TA on the Forwarder
5. Create SplunK Storm Project
6. Copy/paste the below configurations into the project configuration

Until the Splunk Storm team creates a way to import these configurations, you will need to manually copy/paste these into the configurations.  Have fun.  I suggest opening a Pri 4 case with Splunk requesting this feature be added; Let the people be heard.
